        <h2>Mecha Types</h2>
        <p>Mecha come in two general types, usually defined by their capabilities.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Real Robots:</strong><br>The most common type of Mecha, Real Robots are machines whose construction, while still largely based in Sci-Fi physics, tend to follow a more realistic method of unit design.  This generally makes the capabilities of a Real Robot easier to define strictly by measure of performance, as well as makes them easier to produce in large quantities.</li>
        <li><strong>Super Robots:</strong><br>The other primary form of Mecha, Super Robots have been around for longer than Real Robots, but are generally much more open to interpretation.  Super Robots have no set in stone tenants of design like Real Robots do, and as such possess broader, less precise means of measuring their capabilities, to the point of some even being capable to wielding straight-up magic.</li></ul>
